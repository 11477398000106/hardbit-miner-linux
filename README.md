HardBit Launcher Miner XMRig and Nanopool for mine token HBT/algo RandomX(cpu) and Ether(gpu)

## Mining backends
- **CPU** XMRIG-x64/ARMv7/ARMv8
- **GPU** nanopool-AMD/NVIDIA 
## Download
* **[Binary releases](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases)**

## Usage
The preferred way to configure the miner is the [JSON config file](src/config.json) as it is more flexible and human friendly. The [command line interface](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/command-line-options) does not cover all features, such as mining profiles for different algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without miner restart by editing the config file or executing API calls.
